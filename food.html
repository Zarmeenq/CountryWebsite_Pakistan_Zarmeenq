    <p>Pakistani food is famous for its rich flavors, spices, and aroma. Each region of Pakistan has its own special dishes, but all of them reflect the country’s love for bold and delicious tastes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biryani</strong> – a flavorful rice dish with meat and spices</li>
        <li><strong>Nihari</strong> – a slow-cooked beef stew often eaten for breakfast</li>
        <li><strong>Chapli Kebab</strong> – a spicy fried meat patty from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</li>
        <li><strong>Haleem</strong> – a thick, savory dish made with wheat, lentils, and meat</li>
        <li><strong>Samosas</strong> – crispy pastries filled with potatoes or meat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Street food is also very popular, such as gol gappay, chaat, and kebabs cooked on roadside grills. Pakistani desserts like gulab jamun, kheer, and jalebi are sweet favorites enjoyed at festivals and celebrations.</p>
    <p>Tea, especially chai, is a big part of daily life and is served to guests, family, and friends at almost any time of day.</p>
