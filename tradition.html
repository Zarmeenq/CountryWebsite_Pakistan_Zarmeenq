    <h2>Tradition</h2>
    <p>Pakistan has many cultural traditions that come from its long history and diverse ethnic groups. Family is one of the most important parts of life, and people show great respect to elders. Hospitality is also a big tradition—guests are always welcomed warmly and offered food or tea.</p>
    <p>Traditional clothing includes the shalwar kameez, which is worn by both men and women. Women often wear colorful dupattas or embroidered dresses, while men may wear turbans or waistcoats depending on the region.</p>
    <p>Pakistan celebrates many cultural and religious festivals. Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha are the biggest celebrations, marked by prayers, feasts, and family gatherings. Other traditions include mehndi (henna) for weddings, regional dances like bhangra and attan, and folk music played with instruments like the dhol and flute.</p>
