    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>The area that is now Pakistan has a history that goes back thousands of years. It was home to one of the world’s oldest civilizations—the Indus Valley Civilization, famous for its advanced cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.</p>
    <p>Over time, many empires ruled this region, including the Persians, Greeks, Mughals, and the British. Each of these civilizations left behind architecture, art, and traditions that still influence Pakistan today.</p>
    <p>Pakistan became an independent country on August 14, 1947, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The creation of Pakistan was based on the idea of giving Muslims a separate nation where they could practice their religion and culture freely. Since then, Pakistan has grown into a country with a strong identity, a diverse population, and an important place in South Asian history.</p>
