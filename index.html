            Pakistan is known for its rich culture, deep history, and beautiful landscapes—from tall mountains like the K2 to wide deserts and green valleys.
            It was founded in 1947 as a homeland for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. 
            Today, Pakistan is a diverse country with many languages, traditions, and lifestyles. The people of Pakistan are known for their hospitality, strong family values, and cultural pride.
            Pakistan is made up of four main provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan. Each region has its own customs, clothing, food, and celebrations, which together make Pakistan a colorful and vibrant country.
